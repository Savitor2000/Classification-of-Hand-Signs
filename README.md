This project focuses on the classification of hand signs using a machine learning model. The model achieves high accuracy in identifying different hand signs, making it useful for various applications such as gesture recognition and communication aids.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a robust classifier for hand signs. The model was trained and tested on a dataset containing six different hand signs, achieving a test accuracy of 90%.

## Results

### Model Performance

- **Test Accuracy**: 90.0%
